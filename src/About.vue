    h3 Me
    p I am a Singaporean software developer who loves tinkering. I had a long history of interacting with code since young but never took it seriously until I went to university. In SUTD, I chose the road towards Computer Science and never looked back.
    p I am currently unemployed and am taking this chance to learn more about the different technologies available on the web. I recently picked up VueJS and thus, this page was born.

    h3 Skills
    p I consider myself a jack of all trades. I learn and adapt fast by seeking to understand the inner workings of systems. I prefer to fully understand the tool that I am using rather than just hammering with it.
    p I am experienced in Python, Java and Javascript. I am able to do web development (both front and back) and assist in Machine Learning projects.

    h3 Hobbies
    p Besides coding for life, I do watch a lot of anime and play computer games.
    p Anime may seem to appeal to the younger crowd but I feel that the medium allows us to create fantasy worlds beyond what live action can give us.This creates opportunities to exploit for more creative and crazy content.
    p I mostly play indie games because I enjoy the unique gameplay mechanics that the developers come up with.
